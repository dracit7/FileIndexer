Usage : ./search <FileDirection> <keyword1>.....<keywordn>

  This edition stores the results in redis SET, which means
you are required to install and config redis.

  Before launching, you need to open the redis server(command:
redis-server), the IP address should be 127.0.0.1 and the port
used is 6379 by default. If you have changed the IP address or
port-using, you may fail to connect to the server.

  Before searching, you would be asked to input the SETNAME of
the set used, and you can get the results in redis client(command:
redis-cli) by command SMEMBERS <setname_you_have_entered> when
the search is done. You are recommended to delete the SET if you
don't need it as it may pollute your searchinig environment.
